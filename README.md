# SQL-Zagi

The Zagi Retail Company Database Project is developed to demonstrate the entire lifecycle of database creation and manipulation, including designing a relational model, building and populating the database, and performing various SQL operations.

Project Structure

Database Design
The project begins with the creation of a Relational Model:

ER Diagram: Visual representation of the entities and relationships.
Relational Schema: Defines the structure of the database.
Implementation
The implementation includes:

Building the Database: SQL scripts to create the tables as defined in the relational schema.
Populating the Database: Scripts to insert initial data into the tables.
SQL Queries
The project includes a variety of SQL queries demonstrating different operations:

Basic Queries: Using WHERE and ORDER BY clauses.
Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN to combine data from multiple tables.
Set Operations: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT for combining query results.
Aggregate Functions: Functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG to perform calculations on data.
Database Updates: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations to modify data.
Dimensional Model
A Dimensional Model is also developed for analytical purposes:

Dimensional Model Diagram: Represents the structure of fact and dimension tables.
Building and Populating Tables: SQL scripts to create and populate the tables.
Analytical Queries: Using the dimensional model for business intelligence and data analysis.
